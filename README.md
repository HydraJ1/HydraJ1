Hi. My name is Jack, otherwise known as @HydraJ1 on GitHub.

I love computer science, and I love learning tons of new things to help me with programming. I want to explore lots of fields to hopefully know what I want to do in the future with jobs and fun projects. I like many areas and their different aspects, like back-end, front-end, games, UI, and more. Suggest new ideas if you wish.

SKILLS
=
- Python/Pygame
- Basic HTML/CSS
- Fast Learner
- SOCIAL

LEARNING
=
- Git/GitHub
- Unity (?)

Feel free to contact me in one of my upcoming projects if you have any questions, concerns, advice, emotional outbursts, etc. =)
